# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the development of Hoshii. We aim to provide a good collaborating environment for everyone who are involved. The guidelines below will help you through your contribution process.

## Submitting an Issue

Issue such as bug reports, feature requests, or questions are welcome. Please keep in mind that issues submitted must be as detail as possible to avoid any misunderstanding or unncessary questions needed.

- **Before submitting an issue, make sure the issue hasn't exist.**

To keep things organised, we only allow **one** issue opened. Any issues that are marked "duplicated" or overlap will be close eventually. You may use the issue search box, as well as the label tags to check if an issue has been submitted before.

- **Try to include information as detail as possible**

Try to avoid using the keyword "It's not working" or "It bugged" when submitting a bug report. This will only slow down the development with many confusions.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Pull requests are very welcome here. We love to see what changes were brought by unaffiliated contributors. If you are new, the [issue-tracker](https://github.com/helloreindev/hoshii/issues) should provide plenty of existing issues you may work on. Any issues that might be suitable for newcomers will be marked with the [good first issue](https://github.com/helloreindev/hoshii/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue"+) label.

Here are few key things you need to keep in mind before start contributing:

- **Make sure you are familiar with TypeScript and Guilded API**

Keeping a quality of a code has been part of the development environment. We accept all kinds of contributions, but we also tend to keep the code quality of the library. If you are not familiar with any of these, we recommend that you start off with learning the programming language syntax and basic understanding how Guilded API works.

- **Run test before opening a pull request**

Automated tests are an essential part of a code quality and reliable codebase. They helped to make the code more sustainable by ensuring it is safe to reorganise (or refactor) the code in various ways.

- **Make sure no one has work on the same pull request**

With the same reason as the issue section, we only allow **one** pull request opened. Please always check whether the pull request you are working hasn't been work by anyone or doesn't exist. In that way, we can easily track the development progress.
